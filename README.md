## A Discord Bot made for Enigma - The CS Club's Discord Server.

## MaidSama

In 2017, MaidSama's Creator (IceCereal) did not want to study for their exams. Instead, IceCereal decided to make a [`Discord`](https://discordapp.com/) Bot after creating a Server for their class. The first bot [`SuperUserBot`](https://github.com/IceCereal/Discord_SuperUserBot) had only one feature - to take meme's from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). The second version of [`SuperUserBot_V2`](https://github.com/IceCereal/SuperUserBot_V2) was upgraded and cooler than it's previous version.
The bot could:
1. Make Polls
2. Make Memes (from existing templates)
3. Give Admins some extra commands

The bot never got to see the light of day, but it was a major improvement to the first version. Soon after, IceCereal learnt about an improvemnt to the [`Discord's API`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/), the [`Discord.py Rewrite`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/index.html). All progress on the SuperUserBot's halted and on a cold, rainy day in an alley no one will ever know, [`MaidSama (Other Branch)`](https://github.com/IceCereal/MaidSama/tree/master) appeared. The
new kid on the block was sleeker and cooler than the old kids. After nearly a month of development, MaidSama boasted:
1. Commands to warn, strike and kick out members
2. Store a bit of data
3. Store False Commands
4. Welcome new members to the Admin team
5. Take care of certain events

However, after stagnating for a couple of months, the master lost interest. However, despite being in a coma for a couple of months, MaidSama woke up.
